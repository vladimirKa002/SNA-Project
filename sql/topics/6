Why do we need shell scripts:
❏ To avoid repetitive work and automation
❏ System engineers use shell scripting for routine backups, daily tasks etc
❏ System monitoring
❏ Adding new functionality to the shell
❏ Shell language is used in many DevOps technologies to execute tasks in the environment

What are the limitations of shell scripts:
❏ Prone to costly errors, a single mistake can change the command which might be harmful
❏ Slow execution speed
❏ Not well suited for large and complex task
❏ Provide minimal data structure unlike other scripting languages

Define a bash script 
❏ You can use plain Bourne shell (/bin/sh) when special features of Bash (/bin/bash) are not needed
❏ Bourne shell is proprietary code, whereas Bash is open source
❏ Note that Bourne shell (/bin/sh) is usually just a symlink to dash (/usr/bin/dash) on Linux systems
❏ dash is a POSIX-compliant implementation of /bin/sh that aims to be as small as possible

❏ Bash script is a just a list of consequent commands
❏ The #!/bin/bash tells the shell to invoke /bin/bash to run  the script
❏ Use it at the beginning of the script file
❏ Script Execution:
❏ $ bash script_name
❏ $ chmod u+x First.sh && ./script_name.sh
