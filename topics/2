Linux is a free and open source operating system.
❏ At it’s core, the Linux operating system is derived from the Unix OS.
❏ Unix was created in the 1960s by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson
❏ both of them also invented the C programming language (Unix was rewritten in C in 1973)

1. Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces
2. Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness
3. Composition: Design programs to be connected with other programs
4. Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only when you must
5. Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier
6. Robustness: Is the child of simplicity and transparency
7. Diversity: Distrust all claims for “one true way”
8. Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think
