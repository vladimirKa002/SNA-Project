Network engineers design and implement network configurations, troubleshoot performance issues, carry out network monitoring and configure security systems such as firewalls.

OS Boot Process
BIOS/UEFI(Platform init) -> POST(Power on Self Test) -> Bootloader(Find and load OS kernel) -> Kernel(Initialize HW for kernel space)

Most storage devices (HDDs, SSDs, flash drives, CD/DVD, etc) write and read data in blocks. 
S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) is an internal monitoring and reporting technology built into most modern hard drives. Its main purpose is to detect anomalies and predict failure.

Memory Management:
Virtual Memory - OS shows the process that it owns all memory on the computer
Resident Memory - part of the real, physical memory that consumed by the process
Kernel I/O buffers and cache - memory used for I/O data storage/caching
Swap - on-disk additional memory emulation (optional)

Virtual file systems:
Virtual files represent objects that are not files, but can be managed like files. Examples:
❏ named pipes
❏ unix socket files
Virtual file systems are used to represent object hierarchies using virtual files. Examples:
❏ /proc/self/fd/0 - standard input
❏ /dev/stdin - standard input
Main Principle - “Everything is a file”
❏ Sysfs(/sys) - kernel parameters (sysctl)
❏ Procfs(/proc) - processes and process management related parameters
❏ Devfs(/dev) - devices as files
❏ Named pipes and sockets
