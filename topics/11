Logging: /var/log/
❏ historically, Linux has a special directory for storing logs called /var/log
❏ It contains logs from the OS, services, and various applications running on the system.

Most of the log can be splitted as:
System logs: syslog, messages(Redhat), dmesg 
Application logs: apache/httpd, nginx, vbox
Event Logs: auth.log, boot.log
Service Logs: cron

Typical structure for system logs includes:
❏ timestamp
❏ hostname
❏ service name (facility)
❏ message

Examples:
Auth.log:
❏ Keep authentication logs for both successful or failed logins, and authentication processes (such as switching users, using sudo etc) 
❏ Storage depends on system type. For Debian/Ubuntu, look in /var/log/auth.log. For Redhat/CentOS, go to /var/log/secure.
lastlog:
❏ /var/log/lastlog: holds every user’s last login. A binary file you can read via lastlog command. (only works when logged into login tty, Gnome based login is not shown

Login, logouts, failure attempts, tty 
There are 3 files that records relevant information:
❏ /var/run/utmp will give you complete picture of current users logins at which terminals, logouts, system events and current status of the system, system boot time (used by uptime) etc.
	❏ $w and $who - uses utmp to provide relevant data
❏ /var/log/wtmp gives historical data of utmp
	❏ $last - uses wtmp by default
❏ /var/log/btmp records only failed login attempts
	❏ $lastb - uses btmp
