Stream text editors
❏ SED	❏ AWK
Can be used in:
- Logs processing and aggregation (e.g. IPs, user accounts etc)
- Bulk text processing (changing a variable in the code repo)
- Masquerading sensitive information (e.g. find and substitute user names, private data etc)

AWK
❏ Powerful tool for processing and analyzing text of data files which are organized by lines  (rows or records) and columns (fields)
❏ Stream editor that allows to aggregate data with predefined actions/patterns before and  after text is processed
❏ May match regular expressions (but SED is more popular for it)
❏ Variables (including lists and dicts) – may be used for data analysis
❏ Splits line by a field separator (FS)
❏ Allows to use fields as variables – $0, $1, …, $NF
❏ Has various useful String-Manipulation Functions

SED
❏ SED - works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient. But it is sed’s ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.
❏ Print lines with a specific pattern
❏ Remove lines that contain a specific pattern
❏ Print/remove specific range of lines
❏ Various substitutions
❏ Rewrite initial file
❏ Capture groups

Regular Expression - Regex
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.
