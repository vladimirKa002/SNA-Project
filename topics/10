Systemd - is a software suite that provides an array of system components for Linux operating systems. In particular, it provides parallelization capabilities, activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points, and implements dependency-based service control logic.

Systemd's core components include the following:
❏ systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems.
❏ systemctl is a command to introspect and control the state of the systemd system and service manager
❏ systemd-analyze may be used to determine system boot-up performance statistics and retrieve other state and tracing information from the system and service manager.

Systemd components
❏ /lib/systemd - place for files which are default and pre-installed
❏ /etc/systemd - place for user-defined custom configurations
❏ man systemd.unit - main helper for systemd units configuration

Systemd: main abstractions
Units - basic object that systemd manages and acts upon it. Can be as following:
❏ Targets (.target)
❏ Services (.service)
❏ Slices (.slice)
❏ Mount points (.mount)
❏ others

Systemd: targets
❏ /usr/lib/systemd/system/ - units of installed packages
❏ /run/systemd/system/ - runtime units
❏ /etc/systemd/system/ - local configuration by administrator

.target - a unit configuration file which is used for grouping units via dependencies and as standardized synchronization points during start-up.

runlevel vs targets
runlevel:
❏ A runlevel is essentially a set of capabilities or running services that you can pre-define and set the system to boot to so you have a predictable set of services. 
❏ It defines the number and type of daemons that are loaded into memory and executed by the kernel on a particular system
❏ Only one runlevel can be "active" at a time 
❏ It was used before systemd appeared
targets:
❏ In systemd, targets are the new runlevels.
❏ systemd provides a compatibility layer that maps runlevels to targets
❏ systemd can activate multiple targets concurrently not as one runlevel at a time

Create custom target:
❏ Describe the target and create the file in the /etc/systemd/system/<your_target>.target
❏ Create directory /etc/systemd/system/<your_target>.wants
❏ Symlink with the additional services from /lib/systemd/system/ that you wish to enable.
